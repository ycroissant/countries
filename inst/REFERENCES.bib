abstract = {Abstract This paper presents a theoretical growth model which explicitly takes into account technological interdependence among economies and examines the impact of spillover effects. Technological interdependence is assumed to operate through spatial externalities. The magnitude of the physical capital externalities at steady state, which is not usually identified in the literature, is estimated using a spatial econometric specification. Spatial externalities are found to be significant. This spatially augmented Solow model yields a conditional convergence equation which is characterized by parameter heterogeneity. A locally linear spatial autoregressive specification is then estimated providing a convergence speed estimate for each country of the sample. Copyright  2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

 abstract = {Can part of Africa's current underdevelopment be explained by its slave trades? To explore this question, I use data from shipping records and historical documents reporting slave ethnicities to construct estimates of the number of slaves exported from each country during Africa's slave trades. I find a robust negative relationship between the number of slaves exported from a country and current economic performance. To better understand if the relationship is causal, I examine the historical evidence on selection into the slave trades and use instrumental variables. Together the evidence suggests that the slave trades had an adverse effect on economic development.},
